The scripts in this directory are used to synchronize the data to server with the following steps:
(Using the rsync + inotify)
	
	0.  Install the rsync and inotify in server, and rsync in clents.
		$ sudo apt install inotify-tools

	1. Setup for the server

		a. copy the templet file for rsyncd.conf to /etc

		b. copy the templet file for rsyncd.secrets to /etc (user should be same as rsyncd.conf, and password should be same with Clents)

		c. chmod 600 /etc/rsyncd.secrets

		d. sudo systemctl restart rsyncd

		e. sudo systemctl enable  rsyncd (Working and the system startup)


	2. Setup for the Clients:

		a. copy the templet file for rsyncd.secrets to /etc (just hold the password, which is same with the server)

		b. chmod 600 /etc/rsyncd.secrets

		c. copy the run scrpit and set it working after the Clients startup (we use the systemd service)	
			$ sudo cp .../Sync/service/trans.service  /usr/lib/systemd/system/trans.service
			$ sudu systemctl daemon-reload
			$ sudo systemctl start trans.service
			$ sudo systemctl enable trans.service (Running after the Pi startup)
