The files in this fold are used to connect two different local clients using a server and frp

To realize this you should:

1. Install and configure the frps and frps.ini in the server
	./frps -c ./frps.ini	

2. Install and configure the frpc and frpc.ini in the clients
	./frpc -c ./frpc.ini	

3. Realize the auto-running at the startup for server and clients the frpc/frps using the service

4. Connect the different local-network clients with:
	ssh -oPort=remote_port_number pi@your_server_ip

5. Then we could create the ssh-connect without the passwd using the ssh-key:
	ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub(client) -oPort=remote_port_number pi@your_server_ip 	

6. So we can tran the data with rsync now:
	run ./non-realtime/run.py


Note:  we use the rsync to transfer the data from clients to server,
	so the data in server must be backup one schedule.
	The script in ../Backup can access this
